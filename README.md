# Luup-Energenie-EG-PMS-LAN-Single

# Scope

This is a Luup plugin for HTTP control of the Energenie EG PMS (ENER019) LAN IP switches which creates a single device.

Luup (Lua-UPnP) is a software engine which incorporates Lua, a popular scripting language, and UPnP, the industry standard way to control devices. Luup is the basis of a number of home automation controllers e.g. Micasaverde Vera, Vera Home Control, OpenLuup.

# Compatibility

This plug-in has been tested with the following Energenie switches

* EG PMS LAN - > https://energenie4u.co.uk/res/pdfs/ENER019_User_Manual.pdf

# Features

It supports the following functions:

* Creation of a singke devices with on/off buttons for each switch channel
* Set each channel on or off from Vera (discrete power)
* Poll the device regularly to determine the actual status

# Imstallation / Usage

This installation assumes a default/factory set configuration is used, which makes the password '1'

1. Upload the two icon .png files to the appropriate storage location on your controller. For Vera that's `/www/cmh/skins/default/icons`
2. Upload the .xml and .json file in the repository to the appropriate storage location on your controller. For Vera that's via Apps/Develop Apps/Luup files/
3. Create the parent decice instance via the appropriate route. For Vera that's Apps/Develop Apps/Create Device/ and putting "D_Energenie.xml" into the Upnp Device Filename box and the IP address of your Energenie device.

# Limitations

While it has been tested, it has not been tested very much and may not support other related devices or those running different firmware.
